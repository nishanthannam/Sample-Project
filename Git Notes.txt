           		Git :
History of Git:
a. Before developing Git, "Bitkeeper" software was used to manage the complex projects.
b. In 2002, Linus Torvalds and his team started to develop "Linux Kernel" in 2002 and it was managed by "Bitkeeper" but "Bitkeeper" becomes paid software in 2005
c. Linus Torvalds announced a project named "Git" on 6 April, 2005
d. By using "Git", Linus Torvalds and his team managed "Kernel 2.6.12" release
e. "Git 1.0" released on 21 December 2005

Features of Git:
a. Distributed Version Control System
b. Open Source
c. Have Large and Active Community

Installation of Git:
 a. Type "Git for Windows" and click on "Git.org" and click on "Download" button
b. To check whether "Git" is successfuly installed or not, type "Git Bash" on the Start menu.
c. If "Git Bash" is available, then "Git" is successfully installed otherwise not installed

The commands used in Git are:
a. To check the version of Git,
                 Git version
b. To configure a Git or to set up an Identity in Git,
                  Git config --global user.name "Your name"
                  Git config --global user.email "Your Git hub's email id"
c. To find the information about a particular command in Git,
                  Git help Command_name
                  Git command_name --help	 

Repository:
a. In Git, the "Repository" is like a "Data structure" used by VCS to store metadata for a set of files and directories. 
b. It contains the collection of the files as well as the history of changes made to those files. 
c. "Repository" in Git is considered as your project folder. 
d. A "Repository" has all the project-related data.

Where does Repository lives on:
a. Folder 
b. Github
c. Online host

Github Account Creation:
A. Definition of Github:
a. "GitHub" is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. 
b. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere
c. "GitHub" is simply a collection of a large number of repositories

B. "GitLab" is the same as the "GitHub"
NOTE: The difference between "GitHub" and "Gitlab" is only its subscription plans

C. 
a. Type "Github.com" and create a new account by verifying username, email id, and password 
b. We can get a verification code for the email id that we used to create the account in Github
c. After verify the account by using the code in the email id, we will get our account done  
d. By using the above steps, "Github" account will be created successfully

Configuration of Git:
a. The Git can be configured i.e., Git is connected to the Github
b. The steps to set a Git for Identity purpose are:
 1. git config --global user.name "Your Name"
 2. git config --global user.email "The email id that used to connect Git bash"
c. To see the list of all Git config files,
                            git config --list

NOTE: To exit and return to the Git command Window from VM Ware ----> :q

Configuration of Notepad++:
a. Download "Notepadd++" from Google
b. The steps to configure Notepad++ to Git are:
 1. Open "Settings" and type "Advanced System Settings"
 2. In "Advanced System Settings", click on "Environment variables"
 3. In "Environment variables" Window, go to "System Variables"
 4. Add the path of "Notepad++" in "System Variables" Panel and click "OK"
 5. Now, open "Git Bash" and type "Notepad++" 
 6. If "Notepad++" opened, then the configuration is successful 
c. To make Notepad++ as a default editor,
                         git config --global core.editor "Notepad++.exe -multiInst -nosession"

Git Workflow:
The architecture of Git Workflow is:
                                  Working Directory ------> Staging Area / Indexing Area -----> Local Repository ----> Remote Repository (Git Hub)
                                                               ---->                                                    ---->                             ---->
                                                                Add                                                      Commit                          Pull
                                                                <-----------------------------------------------------------     <----
                                                                                      Checkout                                                                   Push
The commands used in Git Workflow are:
a. To display a file present in the Working Directory in Staging Area -----> Git add 
b. To display a file present in the Staging Area in a Local Repository ------> Git commit
c. To display a file presen in the Local Repository in the Remote Repository ----> Git push
d. To display a file present in the Remote Repository (Git Hub) in the Local repository ----> Git pull
e. To exit from the Local repository and come to the Working Directory -----> Git checkout

The terms used in the Git Workflow are:
a. Master:
 “Master” is the default name for a starting branch when you run git

b. Origin:
In Git, "Origin" is a shorthand name for the remote repository that a project was originally cloned from

The command used to copy or clone a repository,
                            Git clone <Repository URL>
The command used to copy or clone a repository with a user defined name,
                            Git clone <Repository URL> <User defined name>

The command used to change Directory in Git Hub is: cd <Directory name>:
The command used to create a folder in the folder is: mkdir <Folder name>
The command used to move to a created folder in a Directory is: cd <Folder name>
The command used to see all the content present in a folder is: ls
The command used to see the content (Hidden and Unhidden) in a folder is: ls -al

The command used to track the files i.e., the modified data is -----> Git status
                                  
Git commit:
"Git commit" is of 2 types.They are:
a. Inline commit -----> Git commit -m "Any Message"
b. Direct commit ----> Git commit ---> It will open the default editor of Git and you have to type a message and close the editor. 
                                                         The message will be reflected automatically in Git
c. The command to see the complete description of the changes you made in the file before you commit is ----> git commit -v
Where,
"v" is "Verbose"
d. The id of "Git commit" is ----> 40 characters
e. The "Commit" is nothing but a snapshot 

The command used to remove a repository from a Working Directory ----> rm -rf

The command used to move multiple untracked filed from Working Directory to the Staging Area is -----> git add .

The steps to initialise a local repository in the Git command line are:
a. git init
b. git add .
c. git commit -m "First commit"
d. git remote add origin <Repository URL>
e. git push -u origin master

NOTE: 
Git pull:
a. We use "Git pull" when one is working alone on the branch. 
b. Since there is no point in reviewing your changes again, you can directly pull them to your repository. 
c. Using "Git pull" command is no different than using Git merge command. 
d. Just keep in mind that "git pull" is a short cut to "git fetch and git merge"

Git stash:
a. "git stash" temporarily shelves (or stashes) changes you've made to your working copy so you can work on something else, and then come back and re-apply them later on
b. "git stash" is used after "git add" and before "git commit"

Git clone Versus Git pull:
a. "git clone" is used for just downloading exactly what is currently working on the remote server repository and saving it in your machine's folder where that project is placed.  
b. "git pull" is a (clone(download) + merge) operation and mostly used when you are working as teamwork.

Git log:
a. "Git log" is a utility tool to review and read a history of everything that happens to a repository. 
b. Multiple options can be used with a "git log" to make history more specific. 
c. Generally, the "git log" is a record of commits.
d. The command that is used to see the differences between 2 commits in "git log" is ----> git log -p
e. The command that is used forthe specific number of commits in "git log" is ----> git log -<The specific number of commits> 
Ex: git log -3 -----> This command shows the latest 3 commits
f. The command that is used to describe the log in a consise manner is -----> git log --pretty=one line ---> This shows all the commits info in 1 line
                                                                                                                   git log --pretty=short -----> This shows all the commits with short information
                                                                                                                   git log --pretty=full -----> This shows all the commits with the name of author and committer
                                                                                                                   git log --pretty=fuller -----> This shows all the commits with authors and committers and their creation date

Status Life cycle:
a. The status Life cycle has 2 types of  life cycles. They are:
 1. Tracked Life cycle
 2. Untracked Life cycle
b. The "Tracked files" has 3 types of  files. They are:
 1. Unmodified state
 2. Modified state
 3. Staged state
c. When we add the files in the "Untracked state", The resultant state directly converted to "Staged state"
d. After we committed a "Untracked file", it will become "Modified file"
		"Diagram of  Status Life cycle"

The command used to shorten the "Git status" is ----> git status --short / git status -s
The format we will see for "Untracked files" for short Git status is ----> ?? untracked
git status -a ----> Status for staging area
git status -M ----> Status for Modified files

Ignoring files:
a. The command to create a git ignore file in a project is -----> Notepad++ .gitignore / VI .gitignore
b. In the project folder, a ".git ignore file" will be created in a .txt format

Rules for .gitignore file:
a. ".gitignore" ignores comments and blank lines
b. The file that we have to ignore will be mentioned here directly
c. Specified file format to ignore: Filename.Format_type
d. If we want to ignore the files of specific type, we can also do that
e. Specified format of the files to ignore: *.Format_name 
f. We can ignore the folders also
g. Specified format of a folder to ignore: Foldername/
h. If we want a particular file from the ignored files present in ".gitignore", we will use "!Filename.Format_type

Git Diff:
a. "Git Diff" command is used in git to track the difference between the changes made on a file
b. "Git Diff" command takes two inputs and reflects the differences between them. 
c. It is not necessary that these inputs are files only. 
d. It can be branches, working trees, commits, and more

Git status:
The "git status" command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area

The command used to check the changes in the staged files line to line is ----> git diff --staged (or) git diff --cached

Git status vs Git Diff:
a. "git diff " depicts the changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc. 
b. "git status" shows you the difference between the working directory and the index and it is helpful in understanding a git more comprehensively.

Git Branch:
a. The "git branch" command lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches. 
b. "Git branch" doesn't let you switch between branches or put a forked history back together again. 
c. For this reason, "git branch" is tightly integrated with the git checkout and git merge commands.
d. "Git branch" is nothing but a pointer to the latest commit
NOTE:
a. "Head" in Git is used to indicate the name of the branch we are working in.
b. Switching branches changes files in your Working Directory

The command used to create a branch is ----> git branch <Branch name>
The command used to move from one branch to another branch is ----> git checkout <The name of the branch you created>
The command used to see all the commits (The commits present in other branches also) is ---> git log --all / git log --oneline --all
The command used to represent all the commits in a grapical representation is ----> git log --all --graph
The command used to create a branch and switching to the created branch at the same time is ----> git checkout -b <Branch name>

Git merge:
a. The "git merge" command lets you take the independent lines of development created by "git branch" and integrate them into a single branch
b. The current branch will be updated to reflect the merge, but the target branch will be completely unaffected.
c. There are 2 types of most commonly used merging strategies. They are:
 1. Fast forward merge
 2. Recursive merge

Fast forward merge:
a. "Fast forward merge" can be performed when there is a direct linear path (Same parent) from the source branch to the target branch. 
b. In "fast-forward merge", git simply moves the source branch pointer to the target branch pointer without creating an extra merge commit.

Recursive merge:
a. "Recursive merge" is the default merge strategy when pulling or merging one branch. 
b. Additionally, this merge can detect and handle merges involving renames, but currently cannot make use of detected copies. 
c. This is the default merge strategy when pulling or merging one branch.

Fast forward merge vs Recursive merge:
    Fast Forward merge	                                  Recursive merge
a. No new commits on the master	                      New commits on the master
b. Linear History	                                       Commit 2 parents
c. No merge commits	                                      Merge commit is created
d. git rebase	                                      git merge–no-ff

The command used to see the content present in a file in a repository is ---> cat <File name>
The command used to merge 1 branch into another branch is ---> git merge <The branch you want to merge>
The command used to delete a branch is ----> git branch -d <The branch you want to delete>
The command used to view the name of the branches that we merged is ----> git branch --merge
The command used to view the name of the branches that are not merged is ----> git branch --no-merge
The command used to view all the branches you creates is -----> git branch -a

Merge conflicts:
a. A "merge conflict" is an event that occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits. 
b. When all the changes in the code occur on different lines or in different files, Git will successfully merge commits without your help.
